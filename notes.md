Notes for my CS 240 class

4/30: learned how to create github and commit (most I already knew, not many notes to add)

5/2: mainly just going over basic coding parts, classes vs functions, differences between java and c++, preferably make different classes for each piece

5/6:
- all code in java written in a class

5/9:
- Collection: arrays but they can be resizeable, as arrays have to have the size declared
- Code should work
